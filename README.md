**University Database Project - SQL**

Hey folks! I'm Hang, an enthusiastic MS Business Analytics Candidate at the University of Denver, Daniels College of Business. Join me on this exhilarating journey through my program, where I've dived headfirst into a sea of diverse projects. These experiences not only let me apply my academic arsenal to real-world business challenges but also honed my analytical prowess.

**Project Name**: University Database Creation.

- Part 1: Create the database using SQL.
- Part 2: Create views and procedures using SQL.

**Project Description**: Utilized Visio Professional for Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and Microsoft SQL Server for database creation.

This is a team project for my Business Database class. All the work are of my teammates and mine.

Thank you for your time!
